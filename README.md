# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Environment
Code editor: VS Code  
Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
Tools: Leaflet, D3.js

## Overview
The purpose of the project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
To achieved this, I used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days.  
I used:  
- JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.  
- Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
